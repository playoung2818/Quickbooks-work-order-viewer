# Work Order Viewer

If you're using **QuickBooks** as your ERP system, this demo app shows you **Content** & **Status** of each Work Order (WO) in a centralized and automated way.

With this tool, you can easily:
- Check **whether a Work Order is completed**
  - If **not completed** → review the **inventory status** for required components
  - If **completed** → inspect the **output details and serial numbers**

## What You Need

To get started, you'll need the following files (all generated from QuickBooks or your production records):

1. `WO.pdf` — The Work Order file from QuickBooks  
2. `WO.doc` — The document listing serial numbers and production details  
3. `Inventory Stock Status.xlsx` — Inventory report exported from QuickBooks  
4. `Open Sales Order by Items.csv` — Sales order report by item from QuickBooks
